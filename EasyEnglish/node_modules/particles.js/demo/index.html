        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I'm a Canadian teacher with over 5 years of international teaching experience. I currently teach nearly 30 students online per week. My current students are from many different countries like Vietnam, Colombia, Ecuador and Costa Rica. I teach English, Math, Science and Social Studies. My teaching experience has been with two reputable curriculums: The Cambridge Curriculum and The Global Ivy Curriculum. I studied Geophysics at the University of Calgary, Canada so I have a very strong background in physics and math. I'm also fluent in Spanish as I'm half Uruguayan. Aside from teaching I develop software. I built this website by myself and have built several other websites, apps and games using the most up to date developer tools. I feel great satisfaction knowing I'm helping others to achieve their goals. Some of my other interests include travelling, fitness, photography and geography.

        <h1>What I offer</h1>
        <p><h3>I'm very excited to be offering 2 different courses based on my areas of expertise:</h3></p>
        <br>
          <ul>
            Traditional English classes for beginners and lower-intermediate students.
            <h5><li>- Build English speaking, grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, reading, listening and writing skills.</li>
              <li>- Lessons uniquely planned for each student, curriculum content influenced by experience using Cambridge and Ivy Global programs.</li> 
              <li>- Create and present a diverse range of projects on interesting topics like holidays, technology and traditions.</li>
            </h5>
            <ul>- Conversational classes for intermediate to advanced students.</ul>
            <h5>This class is designed for students who already have a good base of English and simply want to practice having conversations with a native speaker. I have hundreds of topics that I have experience teaching in conversational classes. This is a great way to learn advanced vocabulary and to practice having a natural conversation at nearly normal speed English. If you feel confident in your English grammar, pronunciation and speaking this course could be for you!</h5>
            <!-- <li>- Spanish lessons for beginners and intermediate learners.</li>
            <h5>I'm very pleased to be offering Spanish lessons to beginners and intermediate students. I've spoken Spanish my whole life as I'm half Uruguayan and was actually born there. If you'd like to learn a new, widely-spoken language other than English, Spanish is a fantastic option! The structure of the lessons will be similar to the traditional English classes but with more emphasis on different areas. For example, pronunciation in Spanish is much easier to grasp but the grammar and verb conjugations particularly are much harder so we will focus on grammar a good deal in this course with the aim of helping you to feel confident using a new language in real life situations.</h5>
            <li>- Introduction to the basics of web development including HTML, CSS, JavaScript and more!</li>
            <h5>Being a software developer is a very in-demand, lucrative career choice. If you've thought about getting into this field of work and want to learn to build your own websites and apps this course will help you to learn the basics. I designed and created this website entirely from scratch. In a relatively short time you can learn how to design and implement websites and apps. I will teach the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as other valuable software and JavaScript libraries that help to create beautiful web pages. Due to the nature of this course I wouldn't recommend this for learners under 16 years old. If you're interested in seeing my web development portfolio please ask in the inquiries section.</h5> -->
