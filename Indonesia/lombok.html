			<h4>Everybody knows of Bali but what if I told you there was a similarly beautiful island just East of it that has far less tourists and even more untouched beauty. That's basically what Lombok is, although it's at the same time quite different from Bali. Lombok like most of Indonesia is muslim so you will see a difference in culture, food and lifestyle. One notable feature is that in muslim areas they don't eat pork, also alcohol is more expensive. Bali in some people's opinion has far too many tourists and doesn't really have any unexplored or untouched areas. The last time I visited in 2018 it was relatively unchanged by tourism except for small pockets of the island. Lombok is where you'll find kilometers of tropical beach and jungle where you are the only person around. It's blissful, beautiful and has what in my opinion is the most beautiful beach I've ever seen in my life. If you're interested in travelling to areas of Indonesia other than Bali, Lombok should absolutely be the first choice. The Gili islands which feature Gili Trawangan, Gili Air and Gili Meno are three popular islands that are part of Lombok. They lie Northwest of the main island itself and are also noteworthy destinations. I've dedicated an entire page to Gili Trawangan so you can visit that to learn more about it. On this page I'll focus on the main island of Lombok. </h4>

		<br>
	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_1">Tanjung Aan Beach is a snow-white beach with bright blue waters, dense forests and impressive cliffsides. It is ideal for swimming, sunbathing, diving and surfing. When I think of which beach that I've been to is my favourite this one comes to mind along with Cabo San Juan in Tayrona National Park in Colombia. The water is pristine, the sand is idyllic and it offers a tranquility that just isn't attainable in other places. You can hike up the cliffs that lie alongside the beach for fantastic views of the beach and surrounding area. This is also one of the most popular spots to watch the sunset in the Kuta area. Make sure to make a trip or two out here if you are in the area. </h5>

    	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_2">While not as nice as Tanjung Aan beach, Kuta beach is the main beach in the town and is a popular spot for locals and foreigners to hang out. I have fond memories enjoying the beach with friends, talking to locals and swimming in the warm waters. This beach is easily accessible if you're staying in Kuta and doesn't require a motorbike or transportation like many of the other beaches including Tanjung Aan. Around this beach you'll find most of the towns tourist infrastructure which includes hotels, restaurants and bars. It's definitely a cool area to visit while in Lombok.</h5>

    	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_3">Mount Rinjani is the massive volcano that is on Lombok. While I haven't actually visited it or hiked it, it doesn't seem right not to mention it in the top things to do in Lombok. I've spent about 5 days on the main island of Lombok and would have loved to have the opportunity to hike the volcano. Its elevation of 3,726 meters makes it the second highest volcano in Indonesia. The most recommended option for hiking the mountain is over 3 days and 2 nights. With that said it requires much more physical fitness and durability than hiking one of the volcanos in Bali. The pictures below aren't mine as I didn't do the hike but they showcase how spectacular the view of the crater lake is. This hike is definitely on my bucket list and I hope to accomplish it in the near future!</h5>

	<h3 id="Second_Point_Header"><u>Best Areas to Stay In</u></h3>
	<br>

	<h5 id="Second_Sub_Point_1">Kuta is located in the south of the island and is relatively close to the main international airport. It's one of the most popular areas for tourists on the island. The town itself is sleepy and you can enjoy a slow pace of life here. While tourism is gaining traction here it's nothing like its neighbour Bali. There are plenty of hotels, restaurants and activities to do based out of Kuta. The beaches are undoubtedly the main draw for many to this area. I greatly enjoyed my time at Pipes Hostel back in 2018 and would recommend it for anyone looking to stay at a hostel in the Kuta area. They can help with arranging motorbikes, recommendations for places to visit and offer food and drinks. The hostel comes with a nice pool and even a halfpipe so if you're into skateboarding it's a no brainer. I believe they also have some private rooms which would also be a nice option for people looking for more privacy. Other features of the Kuta area are rice terraces and dramatic cliffside views.</h5>

    <h5 id="Second_Sub_Point_2">Senggigi is another popular area for tourists. I only spent one night in this area on my way to Gili Trawangan but immediately noticed how beautiful many of the beaches in the area were. There are many hotels and tourist infrastructure in the area and it offers a nice alternative to Kuta and is a good transit point for those enroute to the Gili Islands. </h5>
