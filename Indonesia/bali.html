		<h4>Bali is a tropical paradise located west of Java in Indonesia. It's been known for many years now that this island is special and it's one of my favourite vacation destinations on the planet. The culture is unique and differs largely from the rest of Indonesia. Bali is primarily Hindu but the majority of Indonesia is Muslim. This has led to a unique culture, architecture, food and attitude that the people here have. For art lovers it doesn't get much better than Bali as it seems every single place you look there are carvings, sculptures, temples, rice terraces and paintings. The friendly demeanor of the people mixed with the beautiful landscapes makes for the ultimate tourist destination. Aside from all of this while it thrives because of mass tourism the island has maintained a traditional way of life in many areas and features many different villages and regions that differ from each other. I'll detail some of my favourite areas of the island below and explain how they differ from each other so you can choose the optimal location for your trip! There is also a great variety of delicious food which I never seem to get tired of. From the moment you arrive in the airport and see the architecture and art you will almost certainly be hooked on this place no matter where you are from. Here is my guide to "The Island of Gods", Bali, Indonesia. </h4>

	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_1">The Sacred Monkey Forest in Ubud is a sanctuary and natural habitat of the Balinese long-tailed macaque. This beautiful forest is full of probably thousands of these monkeys and is a very unique place to visit and one of my favourite experiences on the island. They are cheeky little monkeys and like to cause trouble but it's extremely amuzing and entertaining. You are able to purchase fruit like bananas to feed the monkeys. Aside from all the monkeys the lush jungle and traditional Balinese architecture are phenomenal. You can spend a couple hours here walking around and seeing all the fascinating things around.  </h5>

    <h5 id="First_Sub_Point_2">There are plenty of incredible beaches in Bali which is one of the biggest reasons the island is so popular for tourists. You'll find many different kinds of beaches ranging from calm tides to surf beaches to hidden beaches that require a bit of a hike. Some of my favourite beaches on Bali include Greenbowl Beach, Nusa Dua Beach, Canggu Beach, Berawa Beach, Seminyak Beach and Double Six Beach. Canggu is a very popular beach for surfers and you'll find many people here learning to surf at one of the many surf shops along the beach. The most pristine beaches as far as the sand and water quality that I've seen are in the South of the island. Maybe it's because the current isn't as strong here and because the sand is bright yellow and very picturesque. Greenbowl beach is very special. It requires a bit of a hike down a large staircase but rewards you will a small beach with little caves alongside the tranquil waters. Nusa Dua is a more exclusive area which has some of the calmer water on the island. It's a very nice place to go and spend a few hours at the beach. Seminyak and Double Six Beaches are much more commercialized and you'll find plenty of beachfront restaurants/ bars where you can come to eat, have a drink and enjoy the beach.</h5>

	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_3">North of Ubud you'll find the Tegalagang and Jatiluwih Rice Terraces. The Tegalalang Terraces are closer to the town itself while Jatiluwih is a bit farther away. These rice terraces are both stunning and offer some spectacular photography opportunities. There are many little cafes and restaurants along the Tegalalang Terraces with great views where you can enjoy a drink or meal while taking in the spectacular scenery. Swinging over the terraces is a popular activity and there are many little shops and restaurants that have swings. There are many tours that have stops at one of these areas or you can quite easily arrive here by motorbike if you're staying in Ubud. Jatiluwih was less commercialized back in 2016 when I visited but that could have changed. The Jatiluwih Terraces were also much more expansive than Tegalalang. These are both amongst the most scenic rice terraces I've seen in almost 5 years spent in Asia.</h5>

	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_4">Campuhan Ridge Walk is a great hike that you can take starting right in the main Ubud Town area. The walk offers great views of the town, rice fields, the river that runs adjacent and even Mt. Agung (one of the volcanoes in Bali) if you're lucky. The full walk is about 10 km long and typically doesn't have a huge number of people although you will almost certainly see others. From what I've read it's about 3.8 km long and when I did the hike it took me maybe slightly over an hour to go up to the end and back. It's a nice hike if you're staying in Ubud.</h5>

    <h5 id="First_Sub_Point_5">Goa Gajah Cave also known as the Elephant Cave is located near Ubud. It was built in the 9th century and served as a sanctuary. The complex contains both Hindu and Buddhist influence, as the cave contains lingam and yoni, symbol of Shiva, and the image of Ganesha, while by the river there are carved images of stupas and chattra, imagery of Buddhism. The cave is characterized by menacing faces that are carved into the stone, supposedly to ward off evil spirits. The site was more recently rediscovered by Dutch explorers in the 20th century.</h5>

    <h5 id="First_Sub_Point_6">Ulun Danu Beratan Temple is a major Hindu Shaivite Shiva temple complex in the North of Bali. This temple complex is located on the northwest side of Lake Bratan in the mountains near Bedugul in the Tabanan Regency. The date that this temple complex was built isn't known for certain but it's believed to have been built in the 17th century. As the elevation in this area is higher up at about 1,200 meters the temperature can be a bit colder than other parts of the island. The temple is used for ceremonial offerings to the Goddess Dewi Danu, who is the Goddess of water, river and lakes. The volcanic soil in this area is very rich and is great for growing coffee. The water from the lake serves the entire region in the outflow area. Downstream there are many smaller water temples that are specific to each irrigation association.</h5>

    <h5 id="First_Sub_Point_7">Tanah Lot Temple is a sacred Hindu temple a bit North of Canggu. There are actually two temples here. One is located on a boulder and the other is located on a cliff similar to Uluwatu Temple. It's one of my favourite places on the island to watch the sunset. The entry fee as of October 2022 is 60,000 rupiah which is about 4 usd. As it's very popular for both locals and foreigners the area can get quite crowded but it's beauty is still worth a visit. The drive up to the temple itself is beautiful and you'll see plenty of rice terraces and beautiful Balinese architecture on the way.</h5>

    <h5 id="First_Sub_Point_8">Uluwatu Temple is Balinese Hindu temple located in the southern Uluwatu area of the island. It takes about 30 minutes to drive here from Seminyak or kuta. The temple is regarded as one of the sad kahyangan and is dedicated to Sang Hyang Widhi Wasa in his manifestation as Rudra. The temple was built on the edge of a cliff that is about 70 meters high. It's one of the most scenic places to visit in Bali as you can see the long stretch of cliff and the vast ocean. The entry fee was 50,000 idr as of Nov 2022 (~3.50 usd). There are nice walkways on both sides of the main temple which provide great photo taking opportunities and are full of the Balinese long tail Macaques. These monkeys are notorious for snatching things from tourists such as glasses (it almost happened to my girlfriend). You might see many of these monkeys feasting on sweet potatoes or bananas. There is also a Kecak dance performance based on the Ramayana. It is performed daily at the Uluwatu temple at every 6pm on the cliff-side. The performance which is outdoors also shows the beautiful sunset at the background of the performance. I didn't actually see the dance performance myself as I went a bit earlier in the day but it's a popular activity for many visitors to Uluwatu Temple.</h5>

    <h5 id="First_Sub_Point_9">There are many different waterfalls on the island but I'll comment on the ones I've been to. My favourite one was Tegenungan Falls just South of Ubud. The falls themselves are in a beautiful setting surrounded by jungle. There is also a fun day club right next to the falls called Omma Dayclub. There is a minimum spending fee if you want a poolside bed or a proper table but this is pretty standard for dayclubs in Bali. However, if you want to just go for a swim in the pool or sit along the counter or bar and have a drink there's no minimum spending fee so you can go for 1 drink and enjoy the fantastic views and great music. The falls cost 20,000 idr for the entry ticket which is less than 1.50 usd.

	<br>In the North part of the island you can find the Gitgit Waterfalls. It takes a while to get here from Ubud or from the popular Southern tourist areas but it offers a fun experience. The tall waterfall is surrounded by lush vegetation and nice pools of water where people enjoy swimming. From the starting point it's a short trek down a path to get to the waterfalls. It's included as part of many tour packages and is a beautiful place to visit. There are many waterfalls on the island but this is the one that I have experience visiting and I enjoyed my experience here.</h5>

    <h5 id="First_Sub_Point_10">Potato Head Beach Club is probably my favourite beach club that I went to on Bali (though I didn't go to too many to be fair). Located in Seminyak this beach club doesn't have an entry fee and is right on the beach. The day club features a large infinity pool overlooking the ocean. They have a large menu of unique cocktails, craft beers and delicious food. For a day bed by the pool and cabanas there is a minimum spending fee. I believe the minimum spending ranges from 1-2 million idr (65-130 usd). This would be a good options for larger groups of people intending the spend the whole day here. Luckily there is also the option to sit at the bar or at the chill seating area overlooking the ocean. Here there is no mandatory minimum spending so if you just want to stop by for a drink or two and swim this is a great option! The pool is also free to swim in and doesn't require any minimum spending fee. Potato head is actually more than just a day club, it also features a hotel and converts waste into unique products like furniture and clothing. Spending an afternoon at Potato Head is a great time in Bali!</h5>

	<h3 id="Second_Point_Header"><u>Food and Drink</u></h3>
	<br>
	<h5 id="Second_Sub_Point_1">Bali has some phenomenal food choices and specialty dishes. Indonesian dishes like Mi Goreng and Nasi Goreng are quite well known and popular throughout surrounding Southeast Asian countries. Mi Goreng is a dish of noodles served with a type of meat such as chicken or beef and vegetables. Nasi Goreng is similar but replaces the noodles with rice. One of my favourite dishes on Bali is Babi Guling. This dish is unique to Bali as most of Indonesia is muslim and pork isn't very common, however in Bali it is. Babi Guling is essentially suckling pig served with rice and vegetables. The pig is stuffed and infused with a spicy concoction typically involving turmeric, coriander seeds, lemongrass, black pepper and garlic, and traditionally spit-roasted. You can find normal or spicy variations of it. Another famous Indonesian dish abundant in Bali is satay. They are spicy skewers typically of chicken or pork and can be found throughout the island. Bakso is a meatball dish that is a popular street food. It's typically served in a somewhat spicy broth with some noodles, vegetables, crackers and sometimes tofu. One more great dish worth trying here is Nasi Campur. It's a a scoop of rice accompanied by small portions of a number of other dishes, which includes meats, vegetables, peanuts, eggs, and fried-shrimp krupuk. As it's become such a huge tourist destination you can find all sorts of international cuisines on the island ranging from fast food to 5 star international restaurants. Bali's excellent and diverse food scene is just one more reason why it's one of the best tourist destinations in the world. Also, due to Bali's tropical climate there are many fruits and coconuts here. You can enjoy cheap coconuts and nice fruit smoothies for about 1 usd here and of course a Bintang beer. Some unique desserts common on Bali are Es Doger and Es Campur. </h5>

	<h3 id="Third_Point_Header"><u>Places</u></h3>
	<br>

	<h5 id="Third_Sub_Point_1">Canggu is undoubtedly my favourite part of Bali to stay in as it has a bit of all the best elements of Bali. It's located a bit further Northwest on the island is out of the main commercial zones of Kuta, Seminyak and Denpasar. It retains more of a rural town feel but is at the same time full of action and life. Here you'll see beautiful rice terraces mixed with traditional Balinese temples and architecture. The beaches in Canggu are amongst the most popular for surfers and the vibe is peaceful and laid back. There are plenty of local and foreign restaurants, bars, shops and basically everything you need can be found here. I've listed some of my favourite restaurants in the area above. Some good nightlife spots include Old Man Bar, Sand Bar and Faraway Sports Bar and Grill. The area retains its charm and although it's popular with tourists and expats doesn't feel like a place dedicated to mass tourism unlike other areas of the island. The locals here are the nicest out of anywhere I've seen on the island. I highly recommend spending part (if not all) of your trip in Canggu. </h5>

	<h5 id="Third_Sub_Point_2">Ubud is known as the cultural heart of Bali and is the best starting point to see some of the major attractions on the island such as The Sacred Monkey Forest, Goa Gajah, Tegalagang and Jatiluwih Rice Terraces, waterfalls, volcanoes, museums, and the Campuhan Ridge Walk. Ubud is located in the center of the island so it's far from beaches but makes up for it by being culturally rich. To add to that some of the best tourist and art markets in Bali are in Ubud and there are plenty of great restaurants and fun nightlife spots here. I've listed some of my favourite restaurants in Ubud above in the restaurants section and for nightlife I recommend CP Lounge, Why Not Bar and LOL Bar. Much like Canggu I'd recommend spending at least part of your trip here. Tradition, history and spirituality are everywhere you look. This part of Bali will be sure to impress you. Ubud is more commercialized than Canggu and you'll find literally hundreds of souvenir shops here. If you enjoy going to the gym like I do you can check out Ubud Fitness Center. As of November 2022 they offer 90,000 idr (~6 usd) day passes and a week pass for 300,000 idr (~20 usd).  </h5>

	<h5 id="Third_Sub_Point_3">Seminyak is one of the best areas on the island for tourists to stay. There are endless restaurants, bars and some of the nicest beaches on the island. Seminyak is more commercialized than Canggu, Ubud and Kuta. This is also probably the most popular area for shopping as there are hundreds of unique boutique stores. In my opinion this area has the best nightlife on the island and the day bars along Seminyak and Double Six beach are great places to hang out. If you're looking for a gym in the area I highly recommend Hammerhead Fitness. It costs 85,000 idr for a day pass (~6 usd) but costs only 60,000 idr (~4 usd) if you go between 12-4 pm. They have weekly and monthly prices available as well. For nightlife I recommend going to Jalan Kayu Ala and Jalan Camplung Tanduk. You'll find dozens of bars along these streets, many of which are Australian or Irish themed. I've also listed some of my favourite restaurants in the area above which you should definitely try if you are in Seminyak.</h5>

	<h5 id="Third_Sub_Point_4">Kuta is the area just north of the airport which is decently popular for tourists and used to be the main tourist hub before Canggu, Seminyak and Ubud became more popular. This is by no means my favourite part of Bali. I will say it's good for food options and nightlife but I found the shop owners here to be pushy. To be frank, I wouldn't recommend staying in Kuta although a night or two can be a lot of fun. You can see the ground zero monument which was built at the site of Bali's largest terrorist attack which killed 220 people at what was formerly Sari nightclub. It's quite ominous. Check out Jalan Mataram for a large variety of delicious local food!</h5>

    <h5 id="Third_Sub_Point_5">Denpasar is the main city on Bali with just under a million people. Some tourists opt to stay or visit here but it's not as popular of a destination as the other places mentioned above. However, it has tons to offer. As the largest city on the island it's full of history, traditional architecture, markets, monuments and restaurants. The Bajra Sandhi Monument (pictured below) is a huge monument in Denpasar and is certainly worth a visit if you enjoy seeing traditional architecture and learning about history. It's one of the largest monuments I've seen on Bali. The Sindhu Night Market is also a great place to visit. It's full of delicious foods, smells and culture. Denpasar also features some nice beaches along the East coast of the island. These are Sindhu and Sanur beaches. These are a few of my favourite activities in Denpasar. </h5>
