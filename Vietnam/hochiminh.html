		<h4>Ho Chi Minh City, formerly known as Saigon, is the largest city in Vietnam. I actually have lived here for 4 years and continue to spend months at a time here. It's a city that is unlike anywhere else in the world and is one that I've greatly enjoyed living and working in. This is truly a city that never sleeps and I've debatably never been to a city that is so dynamic and energetic. I also find it to have an interesting mix of peacefulness and chaos. After over 4 years of living in this city I've never ran out of things to do or gotten bored. It's a city that has something for everyone and I would absolutely recommend travelling here or even moving here if you're interested in South East Asia. Of all the South East Asian cities I've spent time in this is my favourite one (I know I'm probably a bit bias). As I've spent so much time here I know this city like the back of my hand. My guide to Ho Chi Minh City contains some of my favourite tourist activities, different foods and restaurants that you should try, my breakdown of the different neighbourhoods that I know well and my advice for moving abroad and teaching English in Vietnam. </h4>

	<br>
	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_1">The Ben Thanh Market is an iconic market in District 1 of the city. It's one of the oldest structures in the city and is very well known. During the daytime the market is open and you can find a huge variety of things here ranging from tailor made clothes, accessories, food, coffee and souvenirs. As is common in much of Southeast Asia the prices aren't always fixed and you may have to barder. My advice would be not to accept the first price quoted unless of course there is a price tag on an item. If there isn't a price tag you can try your luck and negotiate for a lower price. Usually it's a back and forth until you settle on a middle price. This can actually be kind of entertaining though if you aren't aware of this part of the culture it may be easy to overpay for things. Even if you overpay for something it's still typically far cheaper compared to most Western countries. At night time the adjacent roads of the market open up the night market which is basically an extension just it's outdoors. Ben Thanh market is probably the most famous market in the city and certainly for tourists but there are literally dozens of markets throughout the city many of which are cheaper in price as they aren't as touristy. Some other cool markets include Binh Tay market in District 6, Ho Thi Ky Flower market in District 10 and Hello Weekend market in District 1. </h5>

    <h5 id="First_Sub_Point_2">Nguyen Hue Walking Street is a popular street in the heart of District 1's financial area. During the evenings this street fills up with people and is full of action and entertainment. You'll see street performers, young people skating, couples enjoying the romantic setting, and people enjoying the many cafes, bars and restaurants along the street. At the Southeast end of the street is the Saigon River and at the Northwest end is the Ho Chi Minh City Hall building. This building is very beautiful and was designed with French architecture as the French colonized Vietnam for a long time. I highly recommend coming to Nguyen Hue and just taking a stroll up the street and seeing what you can find. </h5>

	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_3">This is something I'd only recommend for experienced motorbike drivers or very adventurous people. Since I lived here it was practical for me to drive a motorbike so I could get around easily and this is by far the most common method of transport here. You will see what seems like millions of motorbikes on the streets. Now the traffic can be extremely overwhelming for people who haven't travelled outside of developed countries. It's been said that Vietnam has more motorbikes per capita than any other country. One of my favourite things to do is drive from place to place on a motorbike feeling the hot wind and taking in the endless cityscape views. I actually find it safer being on a motorbike here than walking around as traffic doesn't stop to let pedestrians cross. Sometimes walking in the city can feel like you are constantly in a battle against the traffic but on a motorbike you are part of the flow and it actually seems to slow everything down and make it feel less hectic. Some important tips to remember are that in Vietnam drivers are only responsible for what is infront of them so shoulder checking and looking back isn't common. Bikes will typically change lanes without looking and you just need to really focus on what is in front of you. If you don't want to drive your own bike there are actually different companies that offer tours on motorbike around the city as well as regular apps like grab.</h5>

	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_4">Landmark 81 is the tallest building in Vietnam and at the time of writing this the third tallest in Asia. It's located in the Binh Thanh District. Around Landmark 81 there is the Vinhomes complex. This area has many tall apartment buildings, schools, businesses and activities. The landmark itself has a multi-story shopping mall at the bottom where you can find luxury stores and maybe even see some supercars. There is a cinema and plenty of restaurants and cafes. Further up in the building is an observation deck and more businesses including nightclubs. Landmark 81 is named so because it has 81 floors. It's a very new building and might be more similar to fancier malls that you see in Western countries. It's a cool area to check out though not necessarily the most essential if you're more interested in local culture and tradition.</h5>

    <h5 id="First_Sub_Point_5">The Mekong Delta is just a few hours South of the city and was one of my favourite tourist activities during my first trip to the city. There are different types of tours available. I went on a tour from the city that took us down to the Delta where we boarded onto a boat and then went around the delta from island to island. There are lots of industries down here and it's very fascinating to see how life is on the delta. On the tour I went on we saw a coconut chocolate production area, a crocodile farm on a nice island that you were free to bike around as well, and then a tour in a smaller boat down a creek. It was a very cool tour. Another experience that is extremely unique would be to see the floating market. However, if you're in Saigon it may be somewhat challenging because the day in Vietnam begins very early so by the time that most tours arrive there the market isn't in full operation. Whether it's visiting the floating market, island hopping or both I highly recommend a trip to the Mekong Delta.</h5>

    <h5 id="First_Sub_Point_6">The Cu Chi Tunnels are a chain of tunnels in the Cu Chi area of HCMC. Visiting the tunnels gives you a small insight as to what living conditions the people here went through during the war. Even with the tunnels being expanded for tourists you can experience and empathize with how difficult and clostrophic the tunnels feel. There are different ones that you can go through though if you're very overweight it may be difficult. You don't have to go into the tunnels themselves but you can still see and hear all of the information provided by the guide. There are many tours that take you here and I highly recommend it. You can also see booby traps that the Vietnamese employed and there is even a shooting range nearby that many tours will take you to. This is a very unique experience that you likely won't find anywhere else.</h5>

    <h5 id="First_Sub_Point_7">Vietnam is fantastic for getting custom made clothes for cheap prices. While many tourists enjoy getting a suit or clothes made in Hoi An, HCMC is just as good of an option though you may need to travel around a bit more to find stores as opposed to just walking around the touristy area in Hoi An. With that being said you can expect to pay 20-30 usd for a tailor made collared shirt and maybe slightly more for some work pants. I've had a full kashmere and wool suit made for about 200 usd though it was in Hoi An. I'd expect similar if not cheaper prices in HCMC since it's more of a functional city and has much more to it than just the tourism sector. </h5>
	<br>
    <h5 id="First_Sub_Point_8">The Bitexco tower is the most iconic building in District 1 and likely was the most iconic in the whole city before the Landmark 81 was built. The bitexco observation deck gives you a fantastic 360 degree view of the entire city and costs about 10 usd to enter if I'm not mistaken. This is a great way to take in the true size and expansiveness of the city and shows you different features including it's urban jungle complexion mixed with rivers, canals and even some of the less developed land on the other side of the Saigon River. If you want good photos of the cityscape this might be the best place for that.</h5>

    <h5 id="First_Sub_Point_9">The Saigon Princess is a dinner cruise along the Saigon River that I did with my girlfriend and parents. For about 50 usd/ person you can get a full course meal while taking in some of the cities best views as you cruise along the river. There was live music played with traditional Vietnamese instruments and a great upper deck of the boat where you can take in the best views while enjoying a cocktail. They have different set menus ranging from Asian to Fusion to Western. Aside from The Saigon Princess there are other boat companies that operate different types of cruises along the river. I'd recommend this experience for families and couples.</h5>

    <h5 id="First_Sub_Point_10">Ho Thi Ky Food Street is relatively new in the city but offers great ambiance and food. This is on a tight little street kind of hidden off the main roads and is very popular with locals and increasingly with foreigners. This is one of the best streets in the city to walk down and experience the diverse range of foods that are commonly eaten here. Some foods I'd recommend trying are goi cuon (spring rolls), banh khot (little cakes with shrimp or squid usually), nuoc mia (sugarcane juice) and some sort of meat skewers. There are dozens of options and you will not only have delicious food but truly have a cultural experience. Also not to mention it's extremely affordable!</h5>

	<h5 id="Second_Sub_Point_1">Vietnam is one of the best food destinations in the world and as the largest city in the country HCMC debatably also has the best food. Aside from the endless options of delicious local cuisines there are plenty of international restaurants in the city. I'll mention more about the international restaurants in the restaurant section below but here I'll focus on local dishes that you must try if you visit. Pho is no secret as it's adored by people all over the world. If you thought pho was good in your country you will be blown away by having it here. My personal favourite is Pho Dac Biet which is pho typically with flank steak, raw beef strips, meatballs and tendon though there are variations. Most people know pho but there are so many other great lesser known foods. If you like soup bun bo hue is another incredible soup. It's based out of the Hue region but is extremely popular in Saigon and you'll find restaurants all over that sell it. Other dishes to try include bun thit nuong (vermicelli noodles with meat), bun cha (pork balls, bacon and crab spring rolls with noodles, veggies, fish sauce), com tam (broken rice with porkchop), banh mi (Vietnamese sub), and hu tieu (another type of soup often with seafood or meat). I could go on naming literally dozens of different foods but I think the ones I listed are my personal favourites and amongst the most common.</h5>

	<h5 id="Second_Sub_Point_2">Since I've spent so much time in HCMC I've been able to try literally probably hundreds of different restaurants and of course have determined some of which are amongst my favourite. I'll begin by listing local food restaurants and then will move onto some of my favourite international restaurants. Local food is very affordable by western standards however if you want a meal at a western restaurant you can expect to pay around 10 usd per dish or even more. Here is a list of some great local food restaurants in Ho Chi Minh City:</h5>

	<h5 id="Second_Sub_Point_3">If you love coffee you might be in the best country in the world for coffee. Both the suave taste and strength of the coffee along with the coffee culture is unbeatable from what I've seen. There are cafes on every corner and block of the city. Some of my favourite franchises are Passio, Trung Nguyen Legend, Highlands, Truc coffee, Cong Cafe, and Guta coffee. Aside from the franchises some of my favourite cafes are the lesser known places alongside the river on Hoang Sa and Truong Sa street. This is a peaceful environment where you can enjoy coffee with a nice view of the river (and of course the traffic). Aside from coffee there are many other delicious drinks worth trying. Milk tea/ bubble tea is very popular with locals as well as the peach tea. The peach tea in Vietnam is incredible and if you enjoy this kind of drink you may not be able to find peach tea as good as here. Throughout the day you'll see friends, families, coworkers and couples gathered at cafes enjoying a drink, sometimes working and almost always socializing. The coffee culture in Vietnam is great.</h5>

	<h3 id="Third_Point_Header"><u>Neighbourhoods</u></h3>
	<br>

	<h5 id="Third_Sub_Point_1">District 1 is considered the city center and is one of the best districts to stay in the city. It's roughly split into three areas: Pham Ngu Lao/ Nguyen Cu Trinh area, Financial District/ Nguyen Thai Binh and Da Kao/ Tan Dinh. These areas all vary a bit from each other. In Pham Ngu Lao you'll find the famous Bui Vien street which is known for its nightlife. There are like 100 bars/ clubs on this street and the adjacent streets. It's a fun place for a night out and used to be the most popular area for tourists. My favourite bar in the area is TNR. It's a small dive bar where you can play pool and listen to hip hop music. The financial district is the area of the city with the most skyscrapers. Most of the large banks are based out of here as well as many shopping malls, Nguyen Hue Walking Street, The Bitexco Tower and plenty of bars, restaurants and activities. The Ben Thanh market is basically between the financial district and Pham Ngu Lao. Visit Nguyen Hue, Pasteur St, and Japan town for some good restaurants, sightseeing and nightlife. Da Kao is the area I'm staying in as I write this. It's a bit further North of the rest of District 1 and has a more charming bohemian feel to it. There are many restaurants, cafes, bars and markets in the area. So far I'm enjoying staying in this area a lot as the location is very good if you frequently travel to areas like Phu Nhuan, District 2, Binh Thanh and District 3. Indika is one of my favourite bars/ restaurants in the area and they regularly hold events like comedy shows. Hoang Sa Street runs along the river and is also one of my favourite areas in the city. There are many cafes here you can sit and enjoy the atmosphere by the river.</h5>

	<h5 id="Third_Sub_Point_2">District 2 is probably the most popular area in the city for foreign expats. There are many businesses here that cater to Westerners especially in Thao Dien. Some popular places are The Beer Hall, Hem Chill, Evita, Saigon Outcast, The Orient, Play bar and Buddha bar. There is a lot of food here too both local and western. Popular restaurants include Simple Place, Eddies, Baba's kitchen, Cocotte, and Quan Ut Ut. The Beer Hall also has several little restaurants inside with a delicious variety of food. I definitely recommend this place if you want a night out or good food. There is of course plenty of local Vietnamese food in Thao Dien ranging from Oc (snails) to pho and other local favourites. District 2 is a newer district and was built more spread out than other areas. However due to its proximity to the river and low elevation it often floods. It's slightly farther away from most other main districts in the city too.</h5>

	<h5 id="Third_Sub_Point_3">District 3 is one of the nicer neighbourhoods and more affluent areas of the city. It has a charming vibe and is full of parks, street art, cafes, restaurants and nightlife. It's one of the most popular areas with expats and is one of the most central districts. I often visit this district as my gym, barbershop and many cafes and restaurants that I enjoy are here. For gyms I recommend you go to the New Gym on Dien Bien Phu. There are also some other locations elsewhere in the city. For 1 month it costs 800,000 (~35 usd) vnd and if you renew the next month it's only 500,000 (~20 usd) vnd per month. It has all the necessary equipment and is open 24/7. For a cool barbershop experience visit Liem Barbershop on Nguyen Dinh Chieu. It's a hip hop inspired barbershop franchise where the staff take pride in what they do. There is also a long stretch along the river where there are many nice cafes and restaurants on Hoang Sa and Truong Sa streets. </h5>

	<h5 id="Third_Sub_Point_4">District 4 is a relatively small but action packed district between district 1 and 7. There are some very nicely located apartment towers along the riverside. I lived in the Rivergate Apartment for about 9 months and overall liked district 4. My favourite street in the district is Vinh Khanh which is probably the best street in the city for Oc (snails). There are tons of restaurants here that are always packed with people eating and drinking. It's location is good too as it's just across a bridge from the city center and offers cheaper cost of living as well as offering a more local experience. I'd recommend taking slightly more precaution in this area than in other districts like district 1 or 2. </h5>

    <h5 id="Third_Sub_Point_5">Another interesting and rather central district is District 5. This area is very locals and foreigners are much fewer here than in the neighbouring District 1. Most notably this is where Chinatown is. There is a huge variety of Chinese restaurants and businesses here as well as many parks, temples, pagodas and interesting places for sightseeing. One of my favourite pagodas in the city is the Thien Hau Pagoda. A great burger stand is also located in this district. For a cheap delicious street burger go to Chia Nui Burgers and Sandwiches.</h5>

    <h5 id="Third_Sub_Point_6">District 7 is also one of the newer districts. It's located in the South of the city and is also quite popular with expats although less so than district 2. There are lots of local and western restaurants, bars and businesses in this district as well as new high rise buildings and even some larger houses with yards. There are also good hospitals in this district and many international schools. I've never lived here but have visited different places in the district. While it's not my favourite district many people really enjoy staying here.</h5>

	<br>
	<h5 id="Third_Sub_Point_7">District 10 is maybe the most underrated district in the city. While districts 1, 2 and 3 get lots of popularity district 10 has loads to offer and is more of a secret. I've lived in this district for about 1.5 years of my time in Vietnam. Some of my favourite places in District 10 are Ho Thi Khy food/ flower streets (which I've mentioned many times already) and Su Van Hanh street. On Su Van Hanh you'll find Su Van Hanh mall and probably hundreds of restaurants, bars, cafes, karaoke you name it. It's a fun street to explore and offers a very unique experience as many foreigners aren't aware of this area. Nguyen Tri Phuong in District 10 is also one of the best streets in the city for variety of restaurants. You can find all the local favourites here as well as western fast food, Korean BBQ and more. Aside from all the entertainment in the district there are also many nice temples and great sightseeing opportunities.</h5>

	<br>
	<h5 id="Third_Sub_Point_8">Phu Nhuan is one of my favourite areas of the city and is the district I worked in for 4 years. Phan Xich Long is one of the best streets in the city for restaurants and you'll find a huge variety of food here. Bun Cha Pho Co is one of my go to bun cha spots in the city as it was right down the road from my old workplace. I really enjoyed the food here. My other favourite street in this district is Truong Sa which is a windy road alongside the river. Check out Helen cafe at the Helen Apartments for a fantastic cheap rooftop cafe with 360 views of the city. At nighttime this street fills with locals eating and drinking alongside the river on small plastic chairs. It's one of the best streets in the whole city for nightlife and local food. </h5>

	<h5 id="Third_Sub_Point_9">Binh Thanh is a large district between district 1 and 2. I lived in this district for about 9 months and there is plenty to do and see here. Landmark 81 and the Vinhomes complex are in this district. Also possibly my favourite area of the city for nightlife: Pham Viet Chanh. Some good spots for nightlife here are The Rabbit Hole, Khoai, Birdy, Retro and Hotrod. There are a bunch of other bars and restaurants and over the past couple of years this area has become one of the funnest for nightlife in the city. My favourite outdoor pool in the city is also in Binh Thanh. It's called Van Thanh pool. It's surrounded by a peaceful park alongside the river which offers a nice escape from the urban jungle. The prices in this district are cheaper than in more popular expat areas like districts 1 and 2 so it's a good choice for expats who frequent both those districts often and want a cheaper cost of living.</h5>

	<h5 id="Third_Sub_Point_10">Other than a few nights in District 1, Go Vap was where I spent my first month in Vietnam doing my TESOL certification. I stayed near the AVSE school which is where I got certified. Go Vap is a really cool area in the North part of the city. It's a huge district with lots to do and see. Tourists don't come to this area often so you can experience a very different part of the city here. I have fond memories of having 2 usd pho and 1.50 usd haircuts here. Aside from that there are plenty of restaurants, cafes and nightlife in this district. Many expats choose to live in Go Vap because of a cheaper cost of living. Saigon Chic is a cool cafe with an outdoor pool. I had a company party here once and recommend it if you ever happen to be in the area!</h5>

	<h5 id="Third_Sub_Point_11">Can Gio is a more rural district in the South of the city. I've visited this district many times since my girlfriend's mother is originally from here. It offers a nice escape from the chaos of the city and allows you to experience more nature, local life and sightsee. You have to take a ferry across the river to arrive here but it's extremely cheap (0.25 usd). Pictured below is a really cool temple that you can see soon after getting of the ferry. In English it's called Cao Dai Temple of Binh Khanh. I've been told that it's a unique religion to the area that isn't very common elsewhere. Along the main road off the ferry are plenty of restaurants and cafes. One of the first lefts after getting off the ferry takes you through a busy local market if you visit in the morning time. If you want a different experience where you aren't likely to see any foreigners and minimal signs of Western development you can visit here. Further into the area is also Monkey Island which I haven't yet visited but is quite popular with people in the area.</h5>
