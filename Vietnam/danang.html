		<h4>Da Nang is a city in central Vietnam and is one of Vietnam's most beautiful cities. It's population of just over 1 million makes it considerably smaller than cities like Saigon and Hanoi. Many people are drawn here for it's laid back pace of life, beautiful beaches and stunning nature in the area. I've travelled to Da Nang 3 times so far and will continue to visit as it's a fantastic place. Here are some of my recommendations for Da Nang and the surrounding area.</h4>

	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_1">Marble mountain as the name implies is a large mountain made of marble. It's located roughly in the middle of Da Nang and Hoi An. When you arrive at the mountain you will see many businesses selling marble carved statues ranging from small to huge. You can climb up marble mountain and walk along it's many paths through hidden temples and beautiful carvings. At the top you get spectacular views of the surrounding city. There are also several caves in the mountain where you can explore. This is a really cool place and shouldn't be missed!</h5>

	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_2">The Hai Van Pass is a windy road that spans from Da Nang to a little less than half way to Hue. It's a beautiful road that is on the coast. Full of tropical jungle, beaches and mountains this has been described as one of the best motorbike paths to travel on the planet. It's certainly one of the most beautiful motorbike rides I've had maybe only rivaled by rides in the North of Vietnam. As mentioned however this is something that usually requires a motorbike so it may not be as easy for some people who don't drive motorbikes. There are tours that go here and buses but it wouldn't quite feel the same. Most of the buses that go from Da Nang to Hue actually take a different route so if you're hoping to see if on that leg of your journey double check the bus route.</h5>

	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_3">Beaches span the whole length of the city and are some of the nicest beaches in any city of Vietnam. If you want to enjoy the sun, go for a swim or play some beach sports Da Nang is a great place to do those things. There are plenty of seafood restaurants along the beach where you can have some fresh and diverse seafood.</h5>

    <h5 id="First_Sub_Point_4">Bana Hills is an area about an hour away from Da Nang. It's most famous now for the massive hand bridge that overlooks the Bana Hills. It's truly a beautiful bridge. When I went it was very foggy and we were literally amongst the only people there. I couldn't see the view of the hills due to the fog but being on the hand bridge alone was pretty special. Aside from the bridge there are beautiful Asian style temples at the bottom. Then you take a cable car to get up to the hand bridge area. There is also a little European style village and a small theme park at the top a short walk from the famous bridge. It was a very cool experience. </h5>

    <h5 id="First_Sub_Point_5">On the North side of the city alongside the coast there is Monkey Mountain and the Big Buddha statue. The statue is quite large and overlooks the Sea from it's perch on the mountain. If you continue driving further onto Monkey Mountain past the statue there are smaller windy roads that you can drive around and explore. </h5>

	<br>
	<h5 id="Second_Sub_Point_1">You can find all of the traditional Vietnamese foods in Da Nang as it's quite a large city. There is a big variety of seafood and there are many open air style places along the beach. Aside from this there are many international restaurants due to Da Nang being a popular area for expats.</h5>
	<br>


	<h3 id="Third_Point_Header"><u>Where to stay</u></h3>
	<br>

	<h5 id="Third_Sub_Point_1">My An is one of the most popular areas for foreigners in the city. It's full of entertainment and is right next to the beautiful beach. There are plenty of restaurants and bars in this area and there is a very active expat community here. It would be a good area to stay in while visiting Da Nang. I stayed at the Raon Da Nang Beach Hotel in My An and would recommend it if you're looking for a good value hotel. It was affordable and had basically everything you need for a short stay. It's on a street with plenty of bars and restaurants and is just a short walk from the beach.</h5>

    <br>

	<h5 id="Third_Sub_Point_2">An Hai Bac is another area in the city North of My An. It's also a cool neighbourhood with plenty of activities, restaurants, bars and beaches nearby in the border Phuoc My neighbourhood. From here you can also get nice views alongside the river and see the iconic Dragon Bridge. I stayed at the Grand Jeep Hotel in this area and I would recommend it for anyone travelling here. I would return to this hotel.</h5>
