		<h4>Hanoi is Vietnam's huge capital city albeit the second largest city in the country after Saigon. I've had to opportunity so far to visit the city three times. Modern day Vietnam's culture and tradition is largely influenced by Hanoi and it serves as the headquarters of the government of the country. The city is home to about 8 million people and therefore has plenty of things to see and do. While Saigon is largely cosmopolitan and has historically had more outside influence, Hanoi tries to remain true to its past tradition and rich history. That's not to say it hasn't developed and taken elements from an increasingly globalized world. There are many different important international businesses here and you'll be able to find most things that you need in this city ranging from hospitals to schools to entertainment to manufacturing. Hanoi is a must visit place if you travel to Vietnam in my opinion and I'll highlight a few of my favourite things to do, things to eat and neighbourhoods to visit.</h4>

	<h3 id="First_Point_Header"><u>My top things to do</u></h3>
	<br>
	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_1">The Old Quarter of Hanoi is considered the historic center and is my favourite part of the city to visit. It's characterized by narrow roads and tall French style buildings from the colonial era. The area now is full of businesses such as restaurants, hotels, bars, jewelry, souvenir and clothing stores. The area has lots of historical significance as it was used to be the residential, manufacturing and commercial center of the old city, where each street was specialized in one specific type of manufacturing or commerce. The Vietnamese government is doing its best to preserve the deep rooted Vietnamese tradition and culture in this area and it offers a great glimpse into where lots of the modern day Vietnamese culture stems from. No trip to Hanoi would be complete without visiting the Old Quarter. I'll mention more below in detail different businesses and areas to visit in the Old Quarter. </h5>

	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_2">Hoan Kiem Lake is a large green coloured lake in the Old Quarter of Hanoi. It's also sometimes known as Emerald Lake due to its green colour. Surrounding the lake is a large walkway and park areas that are always full of people and activities. During holidays and weekends you'll frequently see events here with thousands of people attending. You'll see street performers, vendors, skateboarders and people doing yoga and jogging around. The lake offers a tranquil atmosphere in the middle of the big busy city and is a very iconic part of Hanoi. Surrounding the lake are many well-known businesses and picturesque photo opportunities. </h5>

	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_3">The train street is a very unique place to visit in Hanoi. While Saigon also has a train street or two none of them seem to be built up to accomodate tourist visits. The train street in Hanoi runs between many tall buildings. Some of the buildings along the train line here have been transformed into cafes and restaurants. It's a really cool place to visit just walking distance from the Old Quarter. You can sit and enjoy a Vietnamese ice coffee or have a meal and if you're lucky even see a train go by! I highly recommending visiting the train street in Hanoi.</h5>

	<h3 id="Second_Point_Header"><u>Food and drink</u></h3>
	<br>
	<h5 id="Second_Sub_Point_1">As Vietnam's second biggest city it's no surprise that Hanoi is one of the best (if not the best) food destination in the country. Many Vietnamese dishes have their origins in Hanoi. You'll find basically every Vietnamese staple here ranging from Pho to Bun Cha to Com Tam to Banh Mi and many many more. For me the food that stood out the most in Hanoi was the Bun Cha. This is where bun cha originated from. It's a dish of noodles, vegetables, grilled pork balls, bacon and typically crab spring rolls served with fish sauce. It's extremely delicious and the best bun cha I've had was in Hanoi. Check out Bun Cha Dac Kim in the Old Quarter for a fantastic traditional Vietnamese meal! I prioritze having a meal here everytime I visit.</h5>

	<h3 id="Third_Point_Header"><u>Where to stay</u></h3>
	<br>

	<h5 id="Third_Sub_Point_1">I can recommend the Artisan Lakeview Hotel in The Old Quarter of Hanoi. I was lucky to stay on the top floor and it had quite a nice view of Hoan Kiem Lake. It's walking distance from many great places in the city and I found the rooms to be quite nice for the relatively low cost. The Old Quarter is in the Hoan Kiem District of the city and near the hotel you'll find hundreds of restaurants, bars, and entertaining things to do. One place I've enjoying visiting in Hanoi is Puku Sports Bar and Cafe. It's open 24 hours and plays NFL games which in Vietnam happen to begin at midnight or 1 am. Pub Street or King Pirates Pub are also noteworthy places. King Pirates Pub offers egg beer which I tried and found to be quite delicious. The egg is basically blended to create a foamy texture which I'd say is superior to the regular foam from a beer. One other interesting feature that is quite unique to Hanoi is the "Bia hoi" which is basically draft beer sold from kegs on the side of the street. A glass typically costs 25 cents. Vendors typically set up small plastic chairs and tables where you can sit and watch all the people and activities around you. Truly an experience unique to Hanoi. </h5>

    <br>
	<h5 id="Third_Sub_Point_2">West Lake is the most popular area in Hanoi for the expatriot community. While I haven't actually been there personally for a thorough guide I thought it was worth mentioning. This area is more developed and not necessarily trying to retain it's old charm as the old quarter is. There are many modern businesses and amenities. It offers a good quality of life for expats from what I've heard (not saying the Old Quarter or other areas don't). I think many people are drawn to the area because of the massive lake and cosmopolitan feel. The next time I return to Hanoi I'll be prioritizing a visit to this area or possible even staying here to experience a different angle of the city.</h5>
