		<h4>New Delhi is the enormous capital city of India. The metro population of this city is nearly, if not already, 30 million people. That is almost the size of all of Canada's population! Old Delhi had served as the political and financial centre of several empires of ancient India and the Delhi Sultanate, most notably of the Mughal Empire from 1649 to 1857. When the British colonized India they moved the capital to the Bay of Bengal city of Calcutta (now Kolkata). In the 1900's however the capital was moved back to Delhi. The new part of the city was designed and built in the 20th century. This city offers all the new modern amenities of a big global city but also retains it's fascinating history and ancient cultures. There is tons to do and see in New Delhi and I would visit again to explore for longer as I only had 2 days there. It's not for everyone and I will say it's probably the most chaotic city I've ever been to but for people who love adventure travelling like me that's exactly what you want! Here are some activities I'd recommend doing in New Delhi as well as some food suggestions and accomodation advice. </h4>

	<br>
	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_1">The Red Fort is a historic fort that used to be the residence of former Mughal emperors. It's one of Delhi's most popular tourist attractions and is a cool place to visit. The entry fee for foreigners is 500 rupees which is less than 4 usd. It is a monument of national significance; every year on India's Independence Day (15 August), the Prime Minister of India hoists the country's flag at the Red Fort and delivers a nationally broadcast speech from the fort. The fort was plundered of its artwork and jewels in 1739. Most of the forts marble structures were subsequently demolished by the British as well. When you get your entry ticket you can also grab a map which shows you all the different buildings, monuments, pavilions and mosques inside the fort walls. </h5>

	<br>
	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_2">Swaminarayan Akshardham is a Hindu temple, and spiritual-cultural campus in Delhi, India. The complex displays millennia of traditional and modern Hindu culture, spirituality, and architecture. It's one of the most incredible temple complexes I've ever seen (check out my page on Yangon, Myanmar for another good one). The art and symmetry are flawless and you'll be amazed by how beautiful and detailed this place is. Unfortunately, they don't allow cameras in. You have to go through what resembles airport security before entering and they will ask you to put your phones (and possibly other items that are banned) into trays and lockers for safe keeping. For this reason the photos below aren't mine. It's easily accessible by metro and is a short walk from Akshardham station.</h5>

	<br>
	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_3">Chandni Chowk Market is a busy, historic bazaar with clothing, housewares & hardware shops, plus restaurants & snack stalls. You'll feel like you stepped into a time machine and went back a few hundred years. There is so much bustle and action here and it's a great place for shopping. One of my favourite features were all the spice shops. As you walk around you smell the aromas and see so many types of spices. It's no wonder their food is so delicious considering the amount of spices that go into it. You should definitely go for a walk through the Chandni Chowk Market in Old Delhi. It's fairly close to the Red Fort as well as the Jama Masjid.</h5>

	<br>
	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_4">Jama Masjid is one of the largest mosques in India. It was built between 1650 and 1656. The mosque is very picturesque and there is a very large courtyard which apparently can hold up to 25,000 people. Entry is free however foreign tourists aren't allowed to enter during prayer hours (unless you're muslim). It's located right in Old Delhi and makes for a good and relatively short stop on a day exploring the area.</h5>

	<h3 id="Second_Point_Header"><u>Food and Drink</u></h3>
	<br>
	<h5 id="Second_Sub_Point_1">Most of you who have read my other pages on India probably noticed how much I rave about the food. As the capital and largest city in the country Delhi certainly had some of the best food options. There are many restaurants and street food stalls selling basically everything imaginable. Amongst my favourite dishes in New Delhi were Chole Bhatura (chick pea curry with soft puffy bread), chicken tikka malai, and chicken wraps. For Chole Bhatura check out Sita Ram Diwan Chand in the Paharganj area. Chole bhatura is actually a Punjabi dish and is common elsewhere in India as well as in other countries at Indian restaurants. It has become one of my favourite vegetarian dishes. If you see a street food stall like the one pictured below you can choose from a large variety of options. The chicken tikka and chicken tikka malais were always very tasty and cheap. There are many food stalls like this around. One more notable area for food is the Bazar Matia Mahal area directly south of the Jama Masjid. This is another traditional market area full of traditional Mughal, muslim and Indian food. I enjoyed a mutton roganjosh here as well as the general atmosphere. It's a really cool place for adventure lovers. Also, do not hesitate to stop at a food cart and have a chai masala tea. They are delicious, very cheap (~$0.10 usd) and safe to drink.

	<h3 id="Third_Point_Header"><u>Neighbourhoods</u></h3>
	<br>

	<h5 id="Third_Sub_Point_1">Paharganj is one of the most popular areas for tourists to stay in. Main Bazar Road is a bustling backpacker enclave full of budget guest houses and tiny shops selling everything from hippie clothes to incense. It's also very close to the New Delhi railway station as well as other train lines which can take you around the city. I stayed in Paharganj while I was in Delhi. While it's not necessarily my favourite area I've ever stayed in I did enjoy it overall and would stay in this area again. There are many good restaurants here including the Sita Ram Diwan Chand restaurant that serves chole bhatura. I stayed at Hindustan by Backpackers Heaven. It was a nice enough hostel with a good location. I enjoyed relaxing on the rooftop listening to the action below. I'd recommend staying here if you are into hostels. I do believe they also have private rooms. </h5>

	<br>
	<h5 id="Third_Sub_Point_2">Old Delhi is a central and historic part of what is now New Delhi. It was built in the 1600s when Shah Jahan (the Mughal emperor at the time) decided to shift the Mughal capital from Agra. It's known for its bazaars, street food, shopping locations and its Islamic architecture. This is the part of the city where you'll find the Red Fort, Jama Masjid and the Chandni Chowk Market. There is lots to do and explore in this area and it really is fascinating. I'd recommend spending at least an afternoon or full day exploring Old Delhi and it's many attractions.</h5>

	<br>
	<h5 id="Third_Sub_Point_3">I only visited Connaught Place for a few hours one night. It's a far more developed area than Paharganj and Old Delhi. This area provides a nice contrast to the old parts of the city and shows a different side of India. The nightlife here was the most resemblant of Western nightlife that I experienced in all of India. It's also a main financial, commercial and business center in New Delhi. You can access the area by metro, just get off at Rajiv Chowk station. You will get off the metro in the central park which is quite a nice place to wander around for a few minutes. Around this central park are plenty of restaurants and bars that offer modern amenities. Check out "My Bar Headquarters" for a fun nightlife experience in New Delhi. </h5>
