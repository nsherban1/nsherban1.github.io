				<h4>One of my all time favourite cities, there is so much to do and see here. Some of my favourite things to do in Medellin are taking one of the many cable cars, visiting Comuna 13, Laureles, and El Poblado neighbourhoods, seeing the statues at Parque Botero, going to soccer games and enjoying the nightlife.</h4>

	<h5 style="text-align: left;" id="First_Sub_Point_1">There are a few different cable cars that you can take and they all offer quite spectacular views. If you are keen to visit a park you can take the one up to Parque Arvi. This offers a great view of the city then takes you to a large park where you can enjoy nature. They are quite cheap to take and are easy to access by using the metro system. For the Parque Arvi line get off at Acevedo station and if you want to visit another cool one you can go to San Javier station and take the cable car up from there. There's a great view and street food waiting at the top.</h5>

  	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_2">I spent most of my time in the neighbourhoods of Laureles and then El Poblado. El Poblado is the more touristy area which offers great nightlife, many restaurants and lots of commercial activity. Laureles felt a bit more residential but still had good places to eat, go out at night and shop at. The best areas for nightlife in my opinion are in the Parque Lleras area and on Carrera 70 and the surrounding area in Laureles. Parque Lleras has more of a touristy feel and you'll see many foreigners here while Laureles is a bit more local feeling and offers a different ambiance. I spent a month in Laureles in the Conquistadores neighbourhood. It was a beautiful area to stay in as the neighbourhood is full of lush parks. It's also a very central area to stay because you can walk to Laureles, El Centro and easily train to Poblado from here. </h5>

  	<h5>Comuna 13 is an inspiring part of the city to visit. It used to be extremely dangerous but has undergone a revitalization effort that has turned it into a fantastic urban experience focused around art, break dancing, rapping and DJing. The area has become safer and the quality of life has been improving because of these changes. It's definitely worth a visit or a few. You can stop here then go on the cable car from the San Javier metro station. Make sure to get some street food and sugar cane juice while you're here.</h5>

    	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_3">Parque Botero en El Centro is a cool place to visit. It's a big plaza with a bunch of sculptures made by famous Colombian artist Fernando Botero. The Museum of Antioquia right next to the plaza is also full of great art. It's a lively area with many restaurants and vendors around. There were more street markets in this area as opposed to the shopping malls in El Poblado. You can get to this area by the metro easily from Laureles or El Poblado. Just get off at Parque Berrio station.</h5>

    	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_4">Another great experience is to go to a soccer game here. I went to a game between Medellin and Cali (The third biggest city in Colombia). The energy was contagious and I don't think a single person on the Medellin side was sitting at any point throughout the game. There is dancing, singing and drumming all happening in the backdrop of the soccer game. It really is a great experience.</h5>

  	<h3 id="Second_Point_Header"><u>Food and drink</u></h3>
	<br>
	<h5 id= "Second_Sub_Point_1">There is lots of delicious food in Medellin. My personal favourite has to be the bandeja paisa. Traditionally, a Bandeja Paisa consists of two types of Colombian sausage, ground beef, rice, red beans, a fried pork rind called chicharrón, an arepa, a plantain, a slice of avocado (you know, to be healthy) and a fried egg to top it all off. Another Colombian classic are the arepas rellenas (filled arepas). These are kind of like little kebabs. They cut open the arepas and have a large variety of fillings such as beef, chicken, chorizo and mixed. A few other classic foods I enjoyed in Medellin were buñuelos and cazuela de mariscos. To add to these great local dishes it's quite a cosmopolitan city that has food from many different regions. I enjoyed eating things like tacos, pho and chicken wings as well. As with most places the local food is typically quite cheap compared to western options. I always found the food quality to be high in Colombia.

  	<h5 id= "Second_Sub_Point_2">
	Also, as it is Colombia I have to mention the coffee! The locals often drink something called "tinto" which is like a smaller espresso shot with a sweet taste. You can also find more traditional coffees like Cappuchinos and Americanos at cafes such as Juan Valdez. Juan Valdez is a franchise that I've seen around Latin America. It's definitely worth stopping by for a coffee.</h5>
