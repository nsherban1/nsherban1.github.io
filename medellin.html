	<h3><u>Medellin</u></h3>
	<br>
	<h4>One of my all time favourite cities, there is so much to do and see here. Some of my favourite things to do in Medellin are taking one of the many cable cars, visiting Comuna 13, Laureles, and El Poblado neighbourhoods, seeing the statues at Parque Botero, going to soccer games and enjoying the nightlife.</h4>
		<br>
		<br>
	<h5>There are a few different cable cars that you can take and they all offer quite spectacular views. If you are keen to visit a park you can take the one up to Parque Arvi. This offers a great view of the city then takes you to a large park where you can enjoy nature. They are quite cheap to take and are easy to access by using the metro system. For the Parque Arvi line get off at Acevedo station and if you want to visit another cool one you can go to San Javier station and take the cable car up from there. There's a great view and street food waiting at the top.</h5>
