		<h4>Phnom Penh is the capital city and largest city in Cambodia. It sits at the junction of the Mekong and Tonl√© Sap rivers. It was a hub for both the Khmer Empire and French colonialists. It's a city that has a fascinating history which is unfortunately mostly remembered for the recent genocide in which about a third of the countries population was murdered. As such there are different museums that recount and show how things were during this terrible time in the countries history. Aside from it's dark past the city has lots to offer for tourists including great museums with traditional artwork, colourful pagodas and temples as well as great walking areas such as the riverside. The city also has some great nightlife options. Though it's not necessarily on the main tourist trail it's certainly a city worth visiting and is one that I intend to return to soon.</h4>

	<br>
	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_1">The National Museum in Phnom Penh was one of the more memorable museums I've been to. It's full of a large range of artwork ranging from sculptures to paintings. Its collection includes over 14,000 items, from prehistoric times to periods before, during and after the Khmer Empire, which at its height stretched from Thailand, across present-day Cambodia, to southern Vietnam. The building itself is beautiful with it's traditional architecture and features a large courtyard in the middle. This is a great stop if you're in Phnom Penh and is centrally located near many other activities and tourist infrastructure. </h5>

	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_2">Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum is a former secondary school turned prison that was using during the genocide by the Khmer Rouge from 1975-1979. It was said around 20,000 people were imprisoned here of which many were brutally murdered by the regime. It was one of about 150-196 of such torture and execution centers but has become the main one for tourists to visit. As you can imagine the atmosphere is somber as you walk around listening to the audio player they give you. You follow the audio guide as it explains the history and significance of different parts of the prison. You'll see rooms used for torture, some of the weapons used, cells where they imprisoned people and many pictures of victims of this genocide. The barbwire fences and stains are sure to leave you feeling uncomfortable but it's important to understand the reality of what happened. Many people think it couldn't happen to their country and that was the sentiment in Cambodia too. Nobody ever expected this to happen, but it did. This is a tourist experience like no other.</h5>

	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_3">Choeunk Ek Genocidal Center is the former site of the killing fields used by the Khmer Rouge. It's said that up to 1 million people were killed here between 1975-1979 by the regime. Along with Tuol Sleng Museum this center shows people the brutal reality that this country recently faced. The center itself has less to offer visually although the massive stupa full of skulls is bone chilling. When you enter they give you an audio guide which takes you along from station to station explaining the significance of the area or structures. There were mass graves found here and particularly brutal explanations of ways the regime murdered people. It's a place that will leave you feeling upset and distressed but is important for people to see. It's a bit more difficult to get to this one as it's about 17 km from the city center although there are plenty of transport options in the city ranging from transport apps, motorbike rentals and private buses or taxis.</h5>

	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_4">Wat Ounalom is a nice place to visit right in the main part of the city across from the Mekong River. The sparkling pagoda is full of buddha statues and sits in a buddhist compound. As the seat of Cambodia's Mohanikay Order, it is the most important wat of Phnom Penh, and the center of Cambodian Buddhism. It was established in 1443 and consists of 44 structures. It was damaged during the Khmer Rouge period but has since been restored. It's free for tourists to enter.</h5>

You can stroll along and see the flags of the countries and the pop up markets in the area bustling with life. There are many activities going on alongside the river and just across the street on the road running adjacent to the river are many restaurants, bars, cafes and tourist centers. You'll also find the National Museum, Wat Ounalom and the Royal Palace just across the road from the riverside. </h5>

	<h3 id="Second_Point_Header"><u>Food and Drink</u></h3>
	<br>
	<h5 id="Second_Sub_Point_1">There are many restaurant options in Phnom Penh. One thing I've noticed which is in contrast from neighbouring countries like Vietnam and Thailand is that the tourist restaurants often just serve westernized food like pizza, burgers etc rather than local food. Not to say it isn't good but I didn't personally find the culinary experience to be as excited as in other Southeast Asian countries. I'm sure there are tons of good local options however which serve popular dishes like fish curries, Khmer style noodles and soups. You'll find many restaurants on Preah Sisowath Quay which is the road alongside the river and on 172 St. Aside from this there are many local markets where you can also buy food and try local specialties.</h5>
	<br>


	<h3 id="Third_Point_Header"><u>Where to Stay</u></h3>
	<br>

	<h5 id="Third_Sub_Point_1">I've stayed in a few different hostels throughout my three trips to Phnom Penh. These were Onederz, Mad Monkey and the Happy House Zone. The Happy House Zone has since closed but the other 2 are open. The good news is I can recommend both of these hostels. If you're looking for a fun, party experience that includes a pool and pub crawls Mad Monkey is the best option. They feature parties and events both at daytime and night at their pool and bar. Onederz was a bit quieter when I visited but was still great. Overall I'd say the rooms at Onederz felt a bit nicer than Mad Monkey but it didn't quite have the same party atmosphere. The location of Onederz was great as it was right next to the river on Preah Sisowath Quay so walking around the main tourist area was easy. Mad Monkey is located further inland in a more upscale neighbourhood which is also nice to see. It shows a different perspective of the city and this neighbourhood can offer most western amenities and quite frankly surprised me.  </h5>
