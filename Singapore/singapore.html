			<h4>Singapore is a country/ city state located in Southeast Asia just south of Malaysia. It's actually on an island and is seperated from the mainland of Malaysia. Singapore's location and history have made it into an important trading port. In its more recent history it was a British trading post, then was taken over by the Japanese in world war 2 before joining Malaysia in 1963. Due to ideological differences it split from Malaysia in 1965 and became its own sovereign state. Singapore is a very diverse place and has four official languages: English, Tamil, Chinese and Malay. Multiracialism is enshrined in the constitution and continues to shape national policies in education, housing, and politics. Some of my favourite areas to explore were Little India, Chinatown and the Marina Bay Area. You'll see a big blend of cultures here and it's reflected in things like its food, architecture and languages. Singapore is extremely easy to get around due to its excellent mass rapid transit train system. You are never far away from a station and it offers a very cheap way to get around the island country. I only spent three days here but due to its sophisticated transit system I was able to explore quite a lot of the central zone of the city. Here are some of my recommendations.</h4>

		<br>
	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_1">The Gardens by the Bay is a huge garden area located next to the Bay and behind the famous Marina Bay Sands hotel. There are many notable features in the garden such as the Supertree Grove, Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome. Pictured below is the Supertree Grove skywalk which offers some great views of the vast gardens, the Marina Bay Sands hotel, the city skyline and the bay. The skywalk cost 10 singapore dollars per person. You'll also find different statues and interesting things scattered around the gardens. It's accessible by the Bayfront or Gardens by the Bay metro stations. It's also about a 30 minute walk from my next top thing to do which is see the iconic Merlion statue.</h5>

  	<br>
    	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_2">The Merlion Statue is a famous statue that is half mermaid and half lion as the name suggests. It is spewing out water into the bay and offers a great view of The Marina Bay Sands and the city skyline. It's free to come to this boardwalk area and take in the views. The statue is quite large in person and it's a popular place for locals and tourists to hangout. There are a good amount of restaurants located just behind it which offer great views of the bay area. It's a short walk from Telok Ayer station, Downtown station and Raffles Place station on the metro.</h5>

  	<br>
    	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_3">My final favourite thing to see in Singapore is the HSBC Rain Vortex. It's not often that one of a city's main attractions is located in the airport but this one is quite impressive. It's the largest indoor waterfall in the world. It's surrounded by beautifully maintained gardens and is completely free to visit. The roof looks like its caving in and a large stream of water comes gushing down into a large vortex looking thing (hence the name). It's convenient as you can even get a chance to visit it on a short layover. You will need to go through customs but if you have a 4 hour layover in Singapore it's very doable that you can pass through customs go to the Changi Jewel building and see it before going back for your flight. Jewel is accessible from terminals 1, 2 and 3. </h5>

  	<h3 id="Second_Point_Header"><u>Food and Drink</u></h3>
	<br>
	<h5 id= "Second_Sub_Point_1">I greatly enjoyed Singapore's food culture as it's influenced by the many ethnicities that have made the island state their home. Most notably the Chinese, Indian and Malaysian influence have played a big factor in what cuisines are most common. You can find Indian favourites like curries and biryani all around the city. I really enjoyed Gandhi Restaurant in Little India. You can get a vegetarian set of rice and a variety of curries for 5 dollars that is free flow style. On top of that you can order a curry for a few dollars more. I highly recommend this restaurant. You'll see tons of Chinese places, especially in Chinatown, offering food such as Kway Chap, Wonton Soup, dimsum and Meat noodle dishes. There are Malay style places selling things like fried chicken, nasi ayam, satay etc. Aside from the huge influence from these three countries the city is very westernized and has lots of fast food chains and western style restaurants with food such as pizza, burgers etc. There is something for everyone here in terms of food. Some other famous uniquely Singaporean dishes include geylang (a frog porridge) and a Singaporean Crab Curry.

	  <h5 id= "Second_Sub_Point_2">One thing I really enjoyed about Singapore was they had so many great food plazas. They featured anywhere from a few to a couple dozen or more restaurants with huge varities of food. I visited food plazas in Chinatown, The Marina Bay area, Little India and Rochor. Here are a few worth visiting that I enjoyed:
		<br>
		<br>
		<li>Lau Pa Sat (Tons of options: satay, seafood, Indian, Chinese, Turkish, Mexican etc)</li>
		<li>Hong Lim Market and Food Court (Chinese Food)</li>
		<li>Chinatown Complex Food Court (Many Chinese food options)</li>
		<li>Kudai Canteen Tamil Food (Indian food)</li>
		<li>First Stop Food Junction at Queens Street (Chinese food mostly)</li>
