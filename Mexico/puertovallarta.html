		<h4>One of my all time favourite cities, there is so much to do and see here. Some of my favourite things to do
			in Medellín are taking one of the many cable cars, seeing the statues at Parque Botero, going to soccer
			games and enjoying the nightlife. Some of my favourite areas include Laureles, El Poblado and Comuna
			13.There is also lots of delicious food around for you to try. One of the best things about Medellín of
			course are the kind, humble, and helpful people who live there. Truly a great place to visit!</h4>

	<h3 id="First_Point_Header"><u>My top things to do</u></h3>
	<br>
	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_1">There are a few different cable cars that you can take and they all offer quite
		spectacular views. If you are keen to visit a park you can take the one up to Parque Arvi. This offers a great
		view of the city then takes you to a large park where you can enjoy nature. They are quite cheap to take and are
		easy to access by using the metro system. For the Parque Arvi line get off at Acevedo station and if you want to
		visit another cool one you can go to San Javier station and take the cable car up from there. There's a great
		view and street food waiting at the top.</h5>

	<br>
	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_2">Parque Botero en El Centro is a cool place to visit. It's a big plaza with a bunch of
		sculptures made by famous Colombian artist Fernando Botero. The Museum of Antioquia right next to the plaza is
		also full of great art. It's a lively area with many restaurants and vendors around. There were more street
		markets in this area as opposed to the shopping malls in El Poblado. You can get to this area by the metro
		easily from Laureles or El Poblado. Just get off at Parque Berrio station.</h5>

	<br>
	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_3">Another great experience is to go to a soccer game here. I went to a game between
		Medellín and Cali (The third biggest city in Colombia). The energy was contagious and I don't think a single
		person on the Medellín side was sitting at any point throughout the game. There is dancing, singing and drumming
		all happening in the backdrop of the soccer game. It really is a great experience.</h5>

	<h3 id="Second_Point_Header"><u>Food and drink</u></h3>
	<br>
	<h5 id="Second_Sub_Point_1">There is lots of delicious food in Medellín. My personal favourite has to be the bandeja
		paisa. Traditionally, a Bandeja Paisa consists of two types of Colombian sausage, ground beef, rice, red beans,
		a fried pork rind called chicharrón, an arepa, a plantain, a slice of avocado (you know, to be healthy) and a
		fried egg to top it all off. You can find these at many different restaurants around and they can be as cheap as
		5usd and quite easily feed 2 people. Another Colombian classic are the arepas rellenas (filled arepas). These
		are one of the more common street foods around. Arepas are like a type of bread made of ground maize dough. They
		cut open the arepas and have a large variety of fillings such as beef, chicken, chorizo and mixed. An arepa
		rellena can cost as little as 2 usd. A few other classic foods I enjoyed in Medellin were buñuelos and cazuela
		de mariscos. To add to these great local dishes areas like El Poblado and Laureles offer food from many
		different regions. I enjoyed eating things like tacos, pho and chicken wings as well. There are a bunch of
		really good restaurants in the area of Avenida 74 and Avenida Nutibara in Laureles. As with most places the
		local food is typically quite cheap compared to non-local options. I always found the food quality to be high in
		Colombia.

	<h5 id="Second_Sub_Point_2">
		Also, as it is Colombia I have to mention the coffee! The locals often drink something called "tinto" which is
		like a smaller espresso shot with a sweet taste. They are very cheap sometimes as low as a few hundred pesos.
		You can also find more traditional coffees like Cappuchinos and Americanos at cafes such as Juan Valdez. Juan
		Valdez is a franchise that I've seen around Latin America. It's definitely worth stopping by for a coffee. </h5>
	<br>
	<br>

	<h3 id="Third_Point_Header"><u>Neighbourhoods</u></h3>
	<br>

	<h5 id="Third_Sub_Point_1">I spent most of my time in the neighbourhoods of Laureles and then El Poblado. El Poblado
		is the more touristy area which offers great nightlife, many restaurants and lots of commercial activity.
		Laureles felt a bit more residential but still had good places to eat, go out at night and shop at. The best
		areas for nightlife in my opinion are in the Parque Lleras area of El Poblado and on Carrera 70 in Laureles and
		the surrounding area. In both of these areas there are dozens of bars, nightclubs and restaurants. They are
		great areas to explore, meet new people and have a good night out. Parque Lleras has more of a touristy feel and
		you'll see many foreigners here while Laureles is a bit more local feeling and offers a different ambiance. El
		Poblado is the most expensive area in the city and you can expect to pay much lower costs in Laureles
		and other areas. I spent a month in Laureles in the Conquistadores neighbourhood. It was a beautiful area to
		stay in as the neighbourhood is full of lush parks. It's also a very central area to stay because you can walk
		to Laureles, El Centro and easily train to Poblado from here. The city is very accessible by train and it can
		take you almost anywhere you need to go. I would recommend to stay in Laureles if you want a more local
		experience and El Poblado if you want an area with all the touristy comforts such as more English speakers,
		shopping etc. Both are very enjoyable neighbourhoods!</h5>

	<br>
	<h5 id="Third_Sub_Point_3">Comuna 13 is an inspiring part of the city to visit. It used to be extremely dangerous
		but has undergone a revitalization effort that has turned it into a fantastic urban experience focused around
		art, break dancing, rapping and DJing. The area has become safer and the quality of life has been improving
		because of these changes. It's definitely worth a visit or a few. You can stop here then go on the cable car
		from the San Javier metro station. They have the famous outdoor escalator which takes you up to the top of the
		neighbourhood for a fantastic view and great urban experience. Make sure to get some street food and sugar cane
		juice while you're here.</h5>

	<br>
	<h5 id="Third_Sub_Point_4">Another cool neighbourhood in the South part of the city is Envigado. It used to be a
		town that sort of got annexed by the city. I'm not certain if it operates as it's own town or as part of the
		city. One unique feature is the buildings here can't be over a certain height which gives it much more of a town
		feel than other areas of the city. The main plaza is full of action and there are many businesses like
		restaurants, cafes, bars etc. It's also easily accessible by the train line. Just get off at Envigado station.
		This would also be a good area of the city to stay in and would offer a different experience than areas like
		Laureles and El Poblado. </h5>

	<br>
	<h5 id="Third_Sub_Point_5"> If you visit Medellín you will likely spend some time in El Centro. This is where Plaza
		Botero and the Museum of Antioquia are. There are also many other sights to see in this area such as impressive
		churches, parks and government buildings. It's also got a very large outdoor marketplace which begins around
		Calle 45 and Carrera 52. You can walk up Carrera 52 through the market to arrive at Plaza Botero. Under the
		train line adjacent to Plaza Botero there are also more street vendors. They sell anything from clothes to
		souvenirs. There are restaurants, barber shops, and many other businesses around. It's good to visit during the
		day and is easily accessible by train. I didn't spend any nights here however as it has a bit of a reputation
		for being seedy at night.</h5>
