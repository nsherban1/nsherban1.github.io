		<h4>Puerto Vallarta is a beautiful coastal city in the Jalisco state of Mexico. It's long been a popular tourist destination because of it's great year round weather, beaches and local culture. I spent 5 days in Puerto Vallarta in January 2022. The majority of my time was spent in the Zona Romantica and Centro areas of the city. This is my guide to visiting Puerto Vallarta.</h4>

	<h3 id="First_Point_Header"><u>My Top Things to Do</u></h3>
	<br>
	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_1">Malecon Boardwalk is the path that stretches for kilometers alongside the waterfront. Along the boardwalk there are plenty of restaurants, bars and businesses that tourists typically need or visit. When I visited there were frequently shows going on in the big square in El Centro. There was also lots of street food on the boardwalk selling things like shrimp skewers, bbq meat, ice cream and fruit. There's plenty to see and do here and a trip to Puerto Vallarta wouldn't be complete without a walk down the boardwalk. At the South end you can find Playa los Muertos and you can walk out onto the Muelle (dock) (pictured below).</h5>

	<br>
	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_2">If you want a fantastic view of the city or just want some good exercise I suggest walking up to Mirador el Cerro de la Cruz. The hill is just behind the city center. There was also a little cable train that was built to take people up the hill but it seemed to be out of commission when I visited. Once you arrive at the top you can climb the several stairs to get the ideal view of the city. There is also a big cross statue at the top.</h5>

	<h5 id="First_Sub_Point_3">There are many beaches in the area and I've heard that some of the best ones are in more remote areas outside the actual city limits of Puerto Vallarta. The only beach I spent much time at however was Playa los Muertos. It's a lively beach with lots of activities and food. There are vendors selling souvenirs and fresh seafood. There are also plenty of restaurants, cafes and bars on the edge of the beach. You can also walk out onto Muelle de Playa los Muertos for a great view of the beachfront. If you're staying in Zona Romantica this is probably the main beach you'll spend time at. </h5>

	<h3 id="Second_Point_Header"><u>Food and Drink</u></h3>
	<br>
	<h5 id="Second_Sub_Point_1">There's a lot of great food around Puerto Vallarta. As it's a coastal city there is great seafood here. One memorable dish I tried here was a seafood stew. It came with shrimp, fish, squid, oysters, and muscles. Of course as it's Mexico you will find plenty of taco carts around where you can have delicious meals for a few dollars. Most carts also sell things like torta sandwiches and quesadillas. A restaurant we enjoyed going to in Zona Romantica was Mariscos el Guero. I had fantastic smoked marlin, tuna and shrimp tostadas here. I highly would recommend it if you're in the area. Another great restaurant just up the street from here is Pollo Feliz. They have excellent barbecue chicken. If you want a nice beachside restaurant I'd recommend La Langosta Loca. It's a bit pricier as it's on the beach but they did have relatively cheap and tasty tostadas. The view on the beach is worth spending slightly more.

	<h3 id="Third_Point_Header"><u>Neighbourhoods</u></h3>
	<br>

	<h5 id="Third_Sub_Point_1">Zona Romantica is a nice area with traditional Mexican buildings, cobblestone streets and beautiful beaches. It's a very popular area with tourists as there's plenty to see and do. There are many nightlife options in this area ranging from traditional cantinas to Western pubs to LGBTQ dance clubs. I enjoyed El Gringo Cantina and Los Muertos Brewing Co to name a few. I mentioned a few restaurants in the food section which are all in this zone as well. The beachfront part of the Zona Romantica has plenty of restaurants, cafes, bars, stores and activities. It's a great area to spend a vacation in or even live in. There is a large expat community here and the people living here seem to exude a ton of happiness.</h5>

	<br>
	<h5 id="Third_Sub_Point_2">El Centro is the city center and in ways feels similar to Zona Romantica. The main part of the Malecon boardwalk is in El Centro and it's usually quite crowded with people, events and activities. There is a lot of street food around which you should definitely try. There are large cathedrals and many historic buildings in El Centro and it's a very charming area to explore. El Centro has many tourist shops and just everything you need for daily life. </h5>
